# Performance-Study-Of-DAB-Converter


The main aim of this project is to understand the performance of the Dual Active Bridge (DAB) DC-DC converter through simulation studies for high-power density applications. A 24V (input) to 12V (output) DAB converter is modeled using Matlab Simulink software. This project aims to theoretically verify that the performance of the DAB DC-DC converter is suitable for high power density applications. The project report focuses on the study of the Dual Active Bridge (DAB) converter, one of the most prominent topologies of Isolated Bidirectional DC-DC (IBDC) converters. This type of DAB converter serves as an interface between energy storage devices for renewable energy systems applications and is highly applied in automotive applications such as electric, hybrid, and fuel cell vehicles, as well as aerospace applications and personal electronic equipment. Therefore, this type of DAB converter topology requires a detailed and methodical study in terms of its reliability, efficiency, safety, and durable performance operation.
